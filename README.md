Welcome to the Floqer Software Development Internship assignment! This task is designed to assess your technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Below are the details of the assignment:

## Overview:
This assignment involves working on a MERN stack project with specific tasks aimed at demonstrating your proficiency in web development.

## Task 1: Data Table Creation
### Description:
- Create a dynamic table ("main table") showcasing ML Engineer salary data from 2020 to 2024.
